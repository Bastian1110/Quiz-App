          Thank you for playing with us! My name is Pedro, an I'm the quiz cook.
          Today, I'm going to help you have a more guided experience. Below, you
          will find two sections. The section on the left, is where you will
          find all the available categories for your quiz and the number of
          questions you can choose. Once you choose the details of your quiz
          the info will be displayed in the section on the right and once you are ready
          you can click on the button "Create my mix" to get your quiz ready.
